            Valve's Steam Deck is a portable PC designed to take your video
            games on the go. At a glance, Steam Deck looks similar to the
            popular Nintendo Switch, but there are several big differences
            between the two portable systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Steam Deck is only sold through Steam, the most popular storefront
            for PC gaming. Orders placed online take one to two weeks to arrive.
            Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch is widely available at various
            retailers, with more than 114 million consoles sold since its 2017
            release.
          </p>
          <p>
            Steam Deck is designed to be significantly more powerful than the
            Switch, but that doesn't mean it's a better overall console for most
            gamers. In practice, the complexities of the Steam Deck's operating
            system make it harder to use than the Switch, which has a huge
            library of exclusive games designed specifically for the platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            PC enthusiasts will appreciate the performance and customizable
            nature of Steam Deck, but some of the device's shortcomings showcase
            why the Switch is so innovative and popular among young and casual
            gamers.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to price, Nintendo's Switch offers a more affordable
            portable gaming solution with prices ranging from $200 to $350.
            Meanwhile, the Steam Deck ranges in price from $399 to $650.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Steam Deck has three options to choose from that are priced
            mostly based on storage space and drive speed, with the more
            expensive models offering bigger and faster NVMe drives. Meanwhile,
            the different Switch models — Switch Lite, Switch, and Switch OLED —
            offer different design features, like a better screen or the ability
            to hook up to a TV.
          </p>
          <h2>Which gaming handheld is better?</h2>
          <p>
            Ultimately, the choice between a Steam Deck or Switch isn't as
            simple as picking a definitive winner or just going with the most
            powerful or affordable option. Both portable consoles are geared
            toward different kinds of players and you should make your choice
            based on your priorities as a gamer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Getting the best performance requires lots of tinkering, but the
            Steam Deck is widely customizable, giving users more choice over how
            games look. Fans of emulation and cloud gaming will also get more
            long-term use out of the Steam Deck, and it offers all the added
            benefits you get with a working PC.
